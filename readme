This is a copy of the excellent IRremote library for the Arduino modified to work on the Arduino Due while retaining backwards compatibility.

I added send and receive support for a SAMSUNG protocol that someone provided in the comments on Ken’s website since it works for one of my remotes.

I added send and receive support for a protocol I’m calling SAMSUNG2 since I learned it from a Samsung remote.

I added a code size and performance optimization that removes the need to calculate a floating point number for TICKS_LOW and TICKS_HIGH.

I added support for the ATTiny85 and Arduino Due.

To download from github (https://github.com/enternoescape/Arduino-IRremote-Due), click on the "Downloads" link in the upper right, click "Download as zip", and get a zip file.  Unzip it and rename the directory enternoescape-Arduino-IRremote-Due-nnn to IRremote

To install, move the downloaded IRremote directory to:
arduino-1.x/libraries/IRremote
where arduino-1.x is your Arduino installation directory

After installation you should have files such as:
arduino-1.x/libraries/IRremote/IRremote.cpp

For details on the library see the Wiki on github or the blog post http://arcfn.com/2009/08/multi-protocol-infrared-remote-library.html
